#Github Actions- our aeroplane mastermind‚úàÔ∏è
Github Actions is used to ensure that our app is working effectively with no limitations.
There is a workflow that is created inorder to write our code.
To understand it better think of it as the person who ensures that before departure the aeroplane is safely secured, there are no faults, the engines are working and
everything is under control to let it fly.

#Its functionality
Whenever we put a new code github tests to see if everything is working correctly.
It finds errors early and tells us right away what went wrong in the code which is much easier.
It also builds your code and uploads artifacts which can be downloaded and used, artifacts such as APK and AAB etc

In order to find the tests you can go to your github desktop and click on the tab "Actions".
If the tests in the workflow created are successfully ran then a green checkmark will appear to indicate that the tests were successful and
check if the artifacts are uploaded.
If the tests were not successfully ran then a red cross will appear and click on the red cross to see the error and correct it.
