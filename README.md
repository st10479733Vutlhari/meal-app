# My meal app
Greetings welcome to my meal app project😊 this app recommends food suggestions based on time of day of which that is very interesting to hear👌

# Its functionality
What it actually does is that the user will enter input time of the day either morning,afternoon or evening.
Followed by clicking the recommendation button which will then suggest the food based on the time of day.
There will be a variety of food the user can choose from making it more fun to use😎
It has a clear button which clears the input and a exit button which exits the app.
When it comes to cases there is no limitations or restrictions, you can write🖋️ in upper case or lower case as long the spellings are correct.

#Github Actions- our aeroplane mastermind✈️
Github Actions is used to ensure that our app is working effectively with no limitations.
There is a workflow that is created inorder to write our code.
To understand it better think of it as the person who ensures that before departure the aeroplane is safely secured, there are no faults, the engines are working and
everything is under control to let it fly.

#Its functionality
Whenever we put a new code github tests to see if everything is working correctly.
It finds errors early and tells us right away what went wrong in the code which is much easier.
It also builds your code and uploads artifacts which can be downloaded and used, artifacts such as APK and AAB etc

In order to find the tests you can go to your github desktop and click on the tab "Actions".
If the tests in the workflow created are successfully ran then a green checkmark will appear to indicate that the tests were successful and
check if the artifacts are uploaded.
If the tests were not successfully ran then a red cross will appear and click on the red cross to see the error and correct it.
